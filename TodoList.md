# Stuff to do

In order of urgency

 - [x] Add pool browsing
 - [ ] Tidy up editRepository.jsp heading
 - [ ] Add rename and project edit dialog to edit screen and validate repo name to be URL friendly
 - [ ] Unpack deb file in an emphemeral dir to avoid conflicts, and then cleanup.
 - [x] Test with packages that are not in the root of the artifact list.
 - [ ] Add filter count to statistics
 - [x] Add license file to github
 - [ ] Migrate to DB.
 - [ ] Handle case were editing a repository that has been deleted returns empty response (and error popup).
 - [ ] Refactor Dialog classes into single class in javascript.
 - [ ] Add artifact chooser (like build editing screen has)
 - [ ] Add regex test to filter edit dialog.
 - [ ] Packages file should be nice list rather than just text file.
 - [ ] List content counts on "directories" while browsing repo. 
 - [ ] List content size/modified date if a file while browsing repo.
